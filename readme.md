board-framework
======
(aka what runs my website, wofl)

It's pretty much an image board like, say, 4chan - but with~~out~~ image uploading. It includes:

* Threads
* User identification through IPs
* Comments
* Links
* Links between threads
* Emoticons
* Comments
* Length validation
* Images now, I guess

There's not much else, but it's really all that's needed for an online board. 

Run it with `ruby main.rb`. It requires a new-ish sinatra and a ruby >= 2.0.0. It doesn't work on internet explorer either - the formatting on the comments gets messed up.
